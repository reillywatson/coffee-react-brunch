## coffee-react-brunch
Adds [Coffee-React](https://github.com/jsdf/coffee-react) support to
[brunch](http://brunch.io).

## Installation
Add `"coffee-react-brunch": "x.y.z"` to `package.json` of your brunch app.
This must go above coffeescript compilation, or it will run too late in the
pipeline, and you'll get errors saying coffeescript can't understand angle
brackets.
